## 📊 Analytics & Metrics

### Privacy Scoring Algorithm
The privacy score is calculated based on:
- **Tracker Count**: Number of tracking domains detected
- **Cookie Usage**: Types and number of cookies set
- **Permission Requests**: Sensitive permissions requested
- **HTTPS Usage**: Whether the site uses secure connections

### Scoring Scale
- **A (90-100)**: Excellent privacy protection
- **B (80-89)**: Good privacy with minor concerns
- **C (70-79)**: Average privacy, some improvements needed
- **D (60-69)**: Poor privacy, significant concerns
- **F (0-59)**: Very poor privacy, major security risks

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- **Local Storage Only**: All data stored in browser's local storage
- **No Network Requests**: Extension doesn't make external API calls in demo mode
- **Secure Defaults**: Privacy-first configuration out of the box
- **User Control**: Users can clear all data at any time

### Threat Model
- **Tracking Protection**: Blocks known tracking domains and scripts
- **Cookie Management**: Provides easy cookie clearing for privacy
- **Permission Awareness**: Highlights potentially risky permissions
- **Breach Awareness**: Alerts users to compromised accounts

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Version 2.1 (Planned)
- **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual breach monitoring services
- **Enhanced Blocking**: Custom blocking rules and whitelist management
- **Export/Import**: Backup and restore extension settings
- **Dark Mode**: Dark theme option for better user experience

### Version 3.0 (Future)
