## How It Works

### Tracker Blocking
This extension uses Chrome’s **Declarative Net Request (DNR)** API to block known tracking domains and URL patterns at the network layer.

**Examples of targets include:**
- Google Analytics & Tag Manager
- Facebook Pixel
- DoubleClick advertising
- Amazon advertising endpoints
- Twitter analytics
- LinkedIn tracking pixels  
…and many more.

> The blocking rules live in `rules.json` (static DNR rules). User allow/block lists can be applied as **dynamic** rules.

---

### Counting System
- **Daily Count** — Resets automatically at **local midnight**.
- **Monthly Count** — Resets on the **1st** of each month.
- **Real-time Updates** — Counters increment instantly as trackers are blocked.

**Implementation notes (typical approach):**
- Store counters and timestamps in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Use `chrome.alarms` to schedule reset checks.
- On each block event, increment counters and update the badge.

### Privacy Scoring
Websites receive a simple **A–F** grade based on the number of trackers detected:

| Grade | Trackers Detected | Meaning      |
|------:|-------------------|--------------|
| **A** | 0                 | Excellent    |
| **B** | 1–2               | Good         |
| **C** | 3–5               | Fair         |
| **D** | 6–10              | Poor         |
| **F** | 10+               | Very Poor    |
